                        <h1>Ferrari125S</h1>
                        <p>This article is about the 1.5 litre race car built in 1947 by Ferrari. 
                        For the Formula One race car sharing the same engine, see Ferrari 125 F1.
                        The Ferrari 125 S (commonly 125 or 125 Sport) was a 1.5 litre race car built 
                        in 1947 by automaker Ferrari of Modena,
                         Italy, its first vehicle. Only two were made.
                        Although preceded by Enzo Ferrari's Auto Avio Costruzioni 815 of 1940, the 125 
                        S was the first vehicle to bear the Ferrari name when it debuted on May 11, 1947[1] at the 
                        Piacenza racing circuit. Like the 815, but unlike its inline-8 predecessor, partly developed from 
                        Fiat engine components, the 125 S featured a Ferrari designed and built engine; the Colombo V12 (the "125"), 
                        a trait it shared with most Ferrari cars of the following decades. 
                        The 125 S was replaced by the 159 S later in 1947.

                            The Ferrari F40 (Type F120) is a mid-engine, rear-wheel drive sports 
                            car[12] engineered by Nicola Materazzi with styling by Pininfarina. 
                            It was built from 1987 until 1992, with the LM and GTE race car versions 
                            continuing production until 1994 and 1996 respectively.[15] As the successor to 
                            the 288 GTO (also engineered by Materazzi), it was designed to celebrate Ferrari's 
                            40th anniversary and was the last Ferrari automobile personally approved by Enzo Ferrari.[1]
                            At the time it was Ferrari's fastest, most powerful, and most expensive car for sale.[16]
                            The car debuted with a planned production total of four hundred units and
                            a factory suggested retail price of approximately US$400,000 (fivefold the 
                            price of its predecessor, the 288 GTO[17]) in 1987 ($1,030,000 today).[18] 
                            One of those that belonged to the Formula One driver Nigel Mansell was sold 
                            for the then record of Â£1 million in 1990, a record that stood into the 2010s.[19][20] 
                            A total of 1,311[1][21] to 1,315 cars were manufactured with 213 units destined for the United States
